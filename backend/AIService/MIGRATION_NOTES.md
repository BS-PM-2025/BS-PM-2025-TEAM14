# AI Service Migration Notes

## JavaScript to Python Migration

The AI service implementation has been migrated from JavaScript to Python for improved performance and better OpenAI integration.

## Changes Made

- Removed `services/openaiService.js` as its functionality is now handled by the Python implementation in `__init__.py`
- Removed `services/faqService.js` as its FAQ matching is now handled by the Python implementation
- Removed `utils/textUtils.js` as its text utilities are now handled by the Python implementation
- Removed `index.js` as the Python implementation is now the primary interface
- Removed empty directories `services/` and `utils/` after migration
- The Python implementation (`__init__.py`) provides:
  - Real OpenAI API integration with proper error handling
  - FAQ matching functionality similar to the JavaScript version
  - Language detection and multilingual support
  - Text utilities for normalization and processing

## Backup

Original JavaScript files were backed up to the `backup_js_services` directory before removal:
- `openaiService.js`
- `faqService.js`
- `textUtils.js`
- `index.js`

## Current Status

The system is now using the Python implementation imported via `from AIService import processMessage` in `backend/main.py`.

## Next Steps

- Monitor the application to ensure all functionality continues to work as expected
- Update documentation to reflect that the AI service is now Python-based
